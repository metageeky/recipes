# Scratch Pancakes

## Ingredients
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups milk (or more, as needed)
* Butter for griddle or pan
* Powdered sugar (optional)

### Optional
* 1 tsp vanilla extract or 1 tablespoon vanilla powder
* Substitute some flour for whole wheat or oatmeal flour
* Sliced bananas, apples, or other fruit that holds up to mild stirring. Other fruit should 
  be saved to add while cooking.
* If using buttermilk, add a tsp of baking SODA. 

## Directions
### Batter
1. Whisk together the flour(s), baking powder, sugar, and salt. 
2. Create a depression in the dry ingredients and add the eggs and milk. Add vanilla if using.
3. Whisk until eggs are broken and dry ingredients are just about blended. Stop earlier than you think.
4. Add fruit and integate into the batter as little as necessary.
5. Adjust thickness with milk and flour as needed. Batter should not be runny but should flow/spread when put into a pan.

### Cooking
1. Set pan on burner at medium-low heat.
2. Rub the butter over the pan to create a little grease.
3. Add up to 1/4 cup of batter to the pan. Add additional fruit after about 30 seconds.
4. When you start to see set bubbles in the pancake, flip.
5. Continue cooking until both sides are light brown. Flip back and forth as necessary.
6. Remove from pan and sprinkle with powdered sugar if using.
7. Repeat until batter is used up.

## Notes
* Adjust the heat of the pan as you go. You don't want to burn the pancakes but the flipping can cause issues.
* Wipe down the pan from time to time.
* Batter may need adjustments to thickness as you go.
