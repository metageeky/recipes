# Anti-Vampire Kale Pasta

## Ingredients
* 1-2 bunches of kale 
* 2-3 heads of garlic
* 3 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 box of shaped pasta (rotini, gemelli, etc.)
* At least 1 cup or so of cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered
* Feta, cotija, or any briny cheese
* Brine from the cheese (if any)
* salt
* black pepper 
* chili flake (optional)

### Notes
* Every time I make this dish, I seem to add more and more garlic each time. My record is four heads. Note that by
  head I mean the collection of individual cloves. People have attempted to replicate the recipe but only used 2-3
  cloves. It's not as good.
* For kale, I've used all sorts of varieties. Dino kale is my personal fave. Just remember that if you use different
  varieties together, they might have different cooking times.
* I haven't tried this, but you could probably replace the kale with any cooking greens. The timing is what you'll 
  have to be ready for.
* The ratio of kale to pasta is up to you. 
* For the pasta shape, think of pasta that you would use in a pasta salad. They pasta nees to be big enough to pair 
  well with both the cherry tomatoes and decent length strips of the kale. I love gemelli or rotini for this dish.
* You can use any salty cheese really but feta or any other cheese with associated brine just pairs so well. I've done
  parmesan, romano, and other Italian cheeses. Using feta, though, is my preference.
* You might need more olive oil. 

## Hardware
* Pot large enough to cook pasta in
* Large saute pan big enough to eventually handle all the pasta and kale (a wok works)
* Large bowl for the final concoction
* Spoon for the pasta water

## Directions
The key to this dish is timing the pasta and kale so that you can the nearly done pasta into the sauteeing kale. By
finishing the pasta in the garlic, kale, and oil, you get epic flavors.

1. Prepare the basics:
     * Peel and chop all the garlic. You can put it in one big bowl.
     * De-stem the kale and chop. I generally want strips no 2-3 inches in the maximum with no more than an inch
       on the smaller dimension.
     * Wash the kale but let it drip dry. That moisture will be useful to us.
     * Halve or quarter the cherry tomatoes. Save the gooey insides. There's flavor there.
     * Cube or shred the cheese.
     * Get the pot of salted pasta water near to boiling. Yes, salt the pasta water. There's flavor there.
 
 2. Strategize. The goal is to have the high majority of the kale cooked (75-80% or more) by the time the pasta is 
    just at near al dente. Look at the pasta. If your desired doneness takes X minutes, you'll want to pull the
    pasta at X-2 or X-1 minutes. For example, a box of gemelli in my pantry takes 12-13 minutes to reach the doneness
    I prefer. I would let it boil for 11-12 minutes. Always best to test bite a piece before draining.

    Figure out what a good timing will be. Usually, you will need to start the kale first. You can lower the heat on
    the kale if your timing is off. I'll assume that's what ou will be doing.
    
 3. Set the saute pan on a burner at medium heat. Add the olive oil to the saute pan and let it warm up.

    Meanwhile, have the pot of pasta water just near boiling. 
    
 4. Add a tablespoon of the garlic to the oil and any chili flakes if using. Stir occassionally. If the garlic ever
    starts burning, lower the heat. You want to smell the garlic but not fry it.
    
 5. Start adding the kale in bunches. I generally do a pattern of add the kale, stir it around, wait a little bit, 
    and then add more garlic. Repeat after a few minutes. I sometimes toss in a pinch of salt with each new handful
    of kale. 

    Start adding some of the tomatoes if you so desire. I like them cooking down a little. By adding them in stages, like
    the kale, you'll get different levels of doneness. You get complex garlic flavors as well by cooking it in stages.
    
    If the kale starts to look overdone or the pan is too crowded, transfer some of the cooked kale to the serving bowl.

 6. When the timing is right, start the pasta. 
 
 7. Monitor the moisture level in the saute pan. You don't want the kale drowning in moisture, but there should be some
    in there. Spoon out some just in case and/or raise the heat some.

    If the saute pan seems dry, add the cheese brine water or some of the pasta water. I sometimes add more oil if
    cooking instinct suggests it. Always a little.
    
 8. When the pasta is ready, save a cup or so of the pasta water. Drain the pasta. DO NOT RINSE THE PASTA.
 
 9.  Add the pasta immediately to the saute pan. Toss in any remaining garlic, kale, and tomatoes. Stir to integrate. 
    Cook for another minute or two and add pasta water if too dry.
    
 9. Once everything is to a level of doneness you like, empty the pan into your serving bowl. You may want to avoid any
    leftover liquid in the pan. 
    
 9. Add most of the cheese (I save some for individual tastes) and stir to combine. Taste and add salt and black pepper
    to taste. 

### Notes
* When it comes to reheating, I barely do it. This works as a pasta salad straight from the fridge or room temperature.
  One of my best midnight snacks was refrigerator fried chicken and this pasta.
* You can always add more cheese afterwards.
* You'll want bread to mop up the garlicky oil in your plates or bowls.
