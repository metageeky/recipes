# Anti-Vampire Kale Pasta

## Ingredients
* 1-2 bunches of kale 
* 2-3 heads of garlic
* 3 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 box of shaped pasta (rotini, gemelli, etc.)
* 1 cup or so of cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered
* Feta, cotija, or any briny cheese
* Brine from the cheese (if any)
* salt
* black pepper 
* chili flake (optional)

### Notes
* Every time I make this dish, I seem to add more and more garlic each time. My record is four heads. Note that by
  head I mean the collection of individual cloves. People have attempted to replicate the recipe but only used 2-3
  cloves. It's not as good.
* For kale, I've used all sorts of varieties. Dino kale is my personal fave. Just remember that if you use different
  varieties together, they might have different cooking times.
* I haven't tried this, but you could probably replace the kale with any cooking greens. The timing is what you'll 
  have to be ready for.
* The ratio of kale to pasta is up to you. 
* For the pasta shape, think of pasta that you would use in a pasta salad. They pasta nees to be big enough to pair 
  well with both the cherry tomatoes and decent length strips of the kale. I love gemelli or rotini for this dish.
* You can use any salty cheese really but feta or any other cheese with associated brine just pairs so well. I've done
  parmesan, romano, and other Italian cheeses. Using feta, though, is my preference.
* You might need more olive oil. 

## Hardware
* Pot large enough to cook pasta in
* Large saute pan big enough to eventually handle all the pasta and kale
* Large bowl for the final concoction
* Spoon for the pasta water

## Directions
The key to this dish is timing the pasta and kale so that you can the nearly done pasta into the sauteeing kale. By
finishing the pasta in the garlic, kale, and oil, you get epic flavors.

1. Prepare the basics:
     * Peel and chop all the garlic. You can put it in one big bowl.
     * De-stem the kale and chop. I generally want strips no 2-3 inches in the maximum with no more than an inch
       on the smaller dimension.
     * Wash the kale but let it drip dry. That moisture will be useful to us.
     * Halve or quarter the cherry tomatoes. Save the gooey insides. There's flavor there.
     * Get the pot of salted water near to boiling.
 
 2. Strategize

### Notes
* When it comes to reheating, I barely do it. This works as a pasta salad straight from the fridge or room temperature.
* You can always add more cheese afterwards.
* You'll want bread to mop up the garlicky oil in your plates or bowls.
