# Yeast Rolls

Makes 3-4 dozen rolls

## Ingredients
* 1 pkg yeast (not rapid rise)
* 1/4 - 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup shortening 
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 cups warm water
* 5-6 cups flour (minimum)
* 1-2 Tbsp butter (optional)

### Notes
* I've been using less and less sugar each time. I tend to do make a double batch 
  at a time and would probably never go less than 1/4 cup per double batch
* Butter flavored shortening is very good here. I still will add the little bit of real butter
  because butter is AMAZING!
* Soften the butter and shortening before using to make it easier to integrate.

## Directions

### Dough
1. Get a big bowl that is at least 25% larger than what all the ingredients will add up to. We'll
   be letting the dought rise in this bowl.
1. Add sugar to the warm water and let dissolve.
2. Add yeast and stir a little. Set aside until you start to see some bubbling.
3. Add some flour (1/2 to 1 cup) and stir until it's more liquid.
4. Begin adding your shortening, butter, and more flour until you start to get consistency.
5. Add the salt. 
6. Keep stirring and pressing the spoon against the bowl's edge to break up the fats. Add more 
   flour until it becomes a dough that is not too sticky.
7. Time to start kneading. With clean hands, start kneading the dough in the bowl. You'll be wanting
   to both promote gluten forming but also further spread out the fats. Keep adding flour every time
   you find really sticky parts. I find I often add the last cup of flour or two in this session.
8. Knead for 5-10 minutes. I've never over-kneaded this dough because they are meant to be dense and chewy.
9. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a refrigerator over night.

### Baking
1. Take dough from fridge. Punch down. Let warm up and rise for at least an hour.
2. Preheat oven to 425-450.
3. Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
4. Take chunks of dough and roll into an inch thick tube. Cut into 1 inch pieces and roll into balls.
5. For each muffin cup, put 3-4 balls into the cup. Press them down slightly.
6. Bake for 10-20 minutes. For the first batch, I start checking at 10 minutes. Time is usually around 15. 
   Rolls are done when brown on top. 
7. Empty muffin on to a clean towel with rolls bottom up to release any steam and prevent.

### Notes
* Overnighting the dough brings out flavor, but you can make the rolls without it. Just let the dough
  rise for 1-2 hours first.
* I find the muffin tin approach the best, but you can use this dough in multiple ways. I just like 
  how the ball in tin method allows for easy pull-a-part rolls.
* To be really decadent, brush the top of the rolls with melted butter before putting them in the oven.
  Or sprinkle with herbs, sesame seeds, etc.
