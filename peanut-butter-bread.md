# Peanut Butter Bread

(makes a 9x5-inch loaf)

## Ingredients
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 1/3 - 1 1/2 cup whole milk
* 1/2 cup peanut butter

## Notes
* Do use a higher fat milk in this bread. Lower fat milks are too watery to help bind things together.
* You can use a chunky or creamy peanut butter or a mix thereof. The nuts of crunchy PB add a nice texture effect to the point that I would maybe add a tablespoon or two of crushed peanuts if using just creamy.
* You will need to use a shelf-stable peanut butter as in one that does not need to be stirred.
