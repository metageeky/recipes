# Peanut Butter Bread

(makes a 9x5-inch loaf)

## Ingredients
*  2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 1/3 - 1 1/2 cup whole milk
* 1/2 cup peanut butter
* 1-2 tbsp chopped peanuts (optional)

## Notes
* Do use a higher fat milk in this bread. Lower fat milks are too watery to help bind things together.
* You can use a chunky or creamy peanut butter or a mix thereof. The nuts of crunchy PB add a nice texture effect to the point that I would maybe add a tablespoon or two of crushed peanuts if using just creamy.
* You will need to use a shelf-stable peanut butter as in one that does not need to be stirred to incorporate the oil. The secret to this bread not needing emulsifiers like eggs is that they are already in the peanut butter. Products like JIF Natural may suffice.
* You can bake this bread in smaller pans but will need to adjust the baking time. 

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Grease (with butter, shortening, etc.) a 9x5 inch loaf pan (or whatever pans you are using).
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar.
3. Mix in the peanut butter and an initial 1 cup of the milk until it starts to combine.
4. Add 1/3 cup of the milk and combine until the dough becomes moist. You may need to add more milk depending on the moistness of the peanut butter. You want a moist dough that is not liquidy. 
5. Turn/scoop the dough into your prepared pan.
6. Bake for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center can be removed cleanly. I recommend checking at 40 minutes.
7. Cool in pan for 10 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
