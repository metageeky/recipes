# HARD APPLE CIDER BREAD

(makes 1-2 regular loaves plus some mini loaves)

## INGREDIENTS 
* 3 1/2 cups All Purpose Flour 
* 4 teaspoons Baking Powder
* 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
* 3/4 cup brown/natural sugar 
* At least 20 fl. oz. Hard Apple Cider
* 1 apple  (enough to make 1/2 - 3/4 cup chopped)
* Dried apple rings (enough to make 1/2 cup chopped)
* Spices 
* Extra flour for thickening batter
* 1-2 tablespoon Honey (optional)

### NOTES
* The above ingredients are approximate. Even with baking, I tend to play it a little loose.
* For the sugar, I usually do a mix of brown sugar (dark if I have it) and turbinado sugar. This bread benefits from sugar with more a molasses undertone. You could also use honey, but this may require more flour and leavening.
* The hard apple cider you use should be one that has a strong apple finish to it. I particularly like ciders that I would call dangerous in that a kid could drink one and think it is just apple juice. I particularly like Spire’s Dark and Dry. 
* While a 20oz bottle is often enough, my loose hand with ingredients sometimes has me needing to add more moisture. It is much more fun to add more cider than boring water.
* When I’ve made this recipe, I’ve either use one big 20oz bottle of cider or two 12 oz bottles. 
* For the apple, I’d recommend a good tangy, eating apple. Braeburns or Fujis work very well. This is a fun thing to play with given what type of cider you have.
* Dried apples can often be found in a natural foods section. I use Trader Joe’s Dried Apple Rings. If you have leftovers, pair them up with a good cheddar (Dubliner cheese goes very well with them). 
* For spices, it depends on what flavor profile you want. Most people go all cinnamon and nutmeg when it comes to apples. Like Alton Brown, I prefer to accentuate the apple itself. I add about ¾ teaspoon of cloves and 1 teaspoon or more of freshly ground grains of paradise. If don’t have the other, try some freshly ground black pepper. Basically, I want the spices to give some bite.

## DIRECTIONS
1. Peel and dice the apple to make a little more than a half cup. Make the apple pieces the size you want to find in the middle of bread.
2. Chop up the dried apple rings to get about half a cup. I find scissors to be helpful as the dried apples can be tough and gummy.
3. Combine both the fresh and dried apple pieces in a bowl along with no more than half of the hard cider. Let sit for at least 15 minutes. The main goal is to rehydrate the dried apple rings plus infuse the fresh apple as well. 
4. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
5. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. If you are using honey, do not add at this time. Whisk to combine. 
6. Add the soaking apples and most of the remaining cider. Leave an ounce or two aside in case you need to add more moisture. Add the honey too if you are using it.
7. Mix the ingredients. Treat this batter like a quick bread or pancake recipe. You don’t need to over mix, and a few dry spots will cook out. The batter shouldn’t be too wet or too dry but a bit goopy. Add more flour or liquid depending on the consistency.
8. Taste the batter. If you want more spiciness to it or more apple-y goodness, add more. The batter is safe to eat raw (and you will want to!). I sometimes sprinkle in more baking soda/powder as I get paranoid about leavening.
9. Spray loaf pans with cooking spray and spoon batter into each between 1/2 to 2/3 full. Feel free to lick out the bowl and spoon, but be ready for any inebriation that follows.

10. Bake loaves for up to 40 minutes. Mini-loaves cook much faster, of course. Keep an eye on the risen tops to see if they appear set. They are done when a toothpick in the middle comes out mostly clean.

11. Let cool before eating.

## SERVING SUGGESTIONS
* I like mine cold with a little butter, but heating it up real in the microwave also works great. 
* I used the crumbs with vanilla ice cream or yogurt for extra dessertiness.
* This bread also paired well with corned beef and cabbage when I used the grains of paradise. It’s still sweet but pairs well with some savory dishes.

## REMEMBER
Not all the alcohol will cook out of the bread. If you have any sensitivity to alcohol, be prepared. It might not be advisable to eat half a loaf in one sitting and then expect to be productive the rest of the evening. (Not saying that I have such an experience).
