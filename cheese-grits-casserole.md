# Ol' Kentucky Cheese Grits

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 C. quick grits
* 1 C. Milk
* 5 C. water
* 1/2 lb. Cheddar Cheese, grated
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 stick of butter, cubed
* 2 tsp salt
* 2-4 dashes hot sauce 
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 Tbsp. dried dill
* 1 Tbsp. dried chives
* 1/4 - 1/2 C. diced onion (white, yellow, or sweet)
* 1/4 - 1/2 C. diced celery (optional)
* 2 tsp savory salt
* paprika

### Notes
* You can purchase savory salt in the spice aisle or you can make your 
own.  I tend to do the latter by combining celery salt, onion powder, 
white or black pepper, dried mustard power, cayenne, paprika, etc. Tastes much better.


Directions:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Add the milk and water to a large pot and cook the grits in the water until 
thickened according to the directions on the box.  It is best to let the 
grits cook for a few minutes longer than recommended in order to get a 
good creamy texture.  Once the grits are done, remove the pot from heat.  
The following ingredients must be added in a select order to mix well.  
Add the butter and start stirring.  While stirring, add all the 
ingredients except the cheese and the eggs.  Stir a few times and then add 
the cheese in  batches, doing your best to integrate the cheese well into 
the mix.  Stir in the eggs quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs.  Once 
integrated, transfer into an 8.5 x 14 inch pan. 

Cook for 1 hour.  After 50 minutes, sprinkle the casserole with paprika.  
Once out of the oven, let stand for 10 minutes to firm.

To get a thicker casserole, reduce the heat to low and let the pan rest 
in the oven for up to an additional hour.
