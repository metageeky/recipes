# Ol' Kentucky Cheese Grits

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 C. quick grits
* 1 C. Milk (optional)
* 5 C. water (use 6 cups if not using milk)
* 1/2 lb. Cheddar Cheese, grated
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 stick of butter, cubed
* 2 tsp salt
* 2-4 dashes hot sauce 
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 Tbsp. dried dill
* 1 Tbsp. dried chives
* 1/4 - 1/2 C. diced onion (white, yellow, or sweet)
* 1/4 - 1/2 C. diced celery (optional)
* 2 tsp savory salt
* paprika

### Notes
* Most of the spices, herbs, vegetables, and hot sauce are all optional. You can mix up different flavor profiles 
  as you desire. However, the 1 tsp paprika should be added to be truly Kentuckian.
* You can purchase savory salt in the spice aisle or you can make your own.  I tend to do the latter by combining 
  celery salt, onion powder, white or black pepper, dried mustard power, cayenne, paprika, etc. Tastes much better.

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

2. Add the milk and water to a large pot and cook the grits in the water until 
   thickened according to the directions on the box.  It is best to let the 
   grits cook for a few minutes longer than recommended in order to get a 
   good creamy texture.  

3. Once the grits are done, remove the pot from heat.  

4. The following ingredients must be added in a select order to mix well:
     * Add the butter and start stirring.  
     * While stirring, add all the ingredients except the cheese and the eggs.  
     
     * Stir a few times and then add the cheese in  batches, doing your best to 
       integrate the cheese well into the mix.
       
     * Stir in the eggs quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs.  
     
5. Once integrated, transfer the grits mixture into a sprayed 8.5 x 14 inch pan. 

6. Cook for at least 1 hour. The longer you cook, the thicker it will get.

7. Ten minutes before you plan to remove it from the oven, sprinkle the top of the 
   casserole with paprika.  

8. Once out of the oven, let stand for 10 minutes to firm.

### Notes
* If you need to hold the dish, reduce the heat to low and let the pan rest in the oven 
  for up to an additional hour.
* Leftovers are great heated up or left cold. 
* Casserole freezes well.
