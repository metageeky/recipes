# Cheddar-Herb Buttermilk Biscuits

## Ingredients
* 24 oz of white flour 

* 3 tbsp baking powder

* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

* 1.5 tsp kosher salt

* 1 tbsp corn flour or fine cornmeala (just grind to fine in spice grinder)

* 1 tsp powdered sugar

* 1 tbsp dried chives

* 2 tbsp dried dill

* 1 tbsp onion powder

* 1 ounce unsalted butter (diced and chilled)

* 2 ounces shortening (diced and chilled)

* 1 cup finely shredded sharp cheddar (chilled)

* 1-2 cups low-fat buttermilk (chilled)

* Additional flour for dusting

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 400F

2. Sift/whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, corn flour, sugar, chives, dill, and onion powder

3. Add the butter, shortening, and cheese to the bowl. Using a pastry cutter or fork, begin to integrate the fat and dry goods together. Eventually, you will want to move on to using your fingers to rub the them together. Avoid melting the fat. Keep integrating until the mixture resembles course crumbs. Another test is to squeeze a wad of dough. If it forms a smooth texture but crumbles easily, you're good. Otherwise, add more flour or fat until the texture is right.

4. Make a well in the batter and add 1 cup of the buttermilk. Stir gently until the mixture comes together. If all the flour does not get taken up, add more of the buttermilk. The amount you'll need will depend on the humidity and how dry your flour is.

5. Once all the flour is taken up and the dough is not too wet, dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead and fold the dough for 1-2 minutes until it is soft and smooth.

6. Roll the dough to roughly 1in think. Using Using a biscuit cutter of your prefered size, cut out biscuits. Be sure to press the cutter all the way though and twist to punch out the dough. 

7. Take the scraps and reroll out until you have used up all the dough.

8. Place the biscuits on a half-sheet pan so that they barely touch. Dimple the top of each biscuit with your thumb to prevent doming.

9. Bake 15-20 minutes until the biscuits are talk and light gold in color. 

10. Let sit 5 minutes and then turn them out onto a cooling rack or towel bottom side up. Do not depan the biscuits too early due to the cheese needing to gel some first.

11. Devour.

## Notes:
* I recommend King Arthur's flour or a recognized "soft" flour. You can also use a mix of 3:1 all-purpose to cake flour.

* The recipe I have recommend taking cornmeal and just pulsing it in a blender (or spice grinder like I do).

* I often put a layer of cornmeal on the pan along with some cooking spray to make removal easier.

* If it's hot or you have warm hands, you might want to rest the pre-buttermilk dough in a fridge or freezer. Otherwise, the fat can render out when baking. Not good eats.

* If you shred your own cheese, do it very finely. You want the cheese to be pretty finely integrated. The best biscuits I've made have literally involved over 30 minutes of working the dough.

* Other herbage I sometimes add: dried rosemary, thyme, parsley, sage, etc. I tend to avoid fresh herbs in these biscuits due to their moisture content.

- You can replace up to 2/3 of the buttermilk with beer. I recommend a dark porter as it pairs well with the cheddar*
