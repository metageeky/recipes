# Oatmeal Honey Bread

(makes a 9x5-inch loaf)

## Ingredients
* 1 cup honey
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
* 1 1/2 cup rolled oats
* 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 1 cup diced, peeled apple (optional)

## Notes
* You can bake this bread in smaller pans but will need to adjust the baking time.
  
## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Grease (with butter, shortening, etc.) a 9x5 inch loaf pan (or whatever pans you are using).
2. In a saucepan, combine the honey, water, butter, and browng sugar over medium heat. Bring to a simmer but not a roiling boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the oats. Let stand for 10 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Add the diced apple if using.
4. Pour in the cooled honey mixture and apple (if using).
5. Mix until just barely combined.
6. Add the egg and beat well for well for 30 seconds.
7. Turn the dough into the pan and bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center can be removed cleanly. I recommend checking at 35 minutes.
8. *Optional* The bread may be removed from the loaf plan, put on a baking sheet, and then brushed with honey immediately after baking. Return to the oven for 2 minutes at 400F (205C) to create a honey glaze.
